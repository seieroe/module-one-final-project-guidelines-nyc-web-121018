# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# c1 = Customer.create(name: "Carole", age: 41, bank_account: 4553)

# c1 = Customer.create("Dan", age: 17, bank_account: 18145)
# c1 = Customer.create("Seth", age: 23, bank_account: 328)
